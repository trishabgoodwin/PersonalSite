            I'm a lifelong learner and love a good challenge. I have strong family values
            and love to help others. I spend my free time with my family or challenging myself
            with something new.

            For the over ten years I have devoted myself to the education of others, while maintainig
            rigorous expectations for myself as a professional and team player, as well. I'm exited
            to being the pursuit of a career that will allow me to showcase my work ethic and teamworking 
            skills while providing numerous opportunites for growth and success.
